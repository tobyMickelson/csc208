## chapter 1.3

### logical equivalence

logical equivalance is when two statements have the same result

one such example is that `if P then Q` is logically equivalent to `not P or Q`

### modus tollens

if given `if P then Q`, and given `P`, then `Q` can be inferred

if given `if P then Q`, and given `not P`, then `not Q` can be inferred
